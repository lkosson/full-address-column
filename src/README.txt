Full address column
===================

This add-on adds four new columns called "Sender (@)", "Sender Domain (@)",
"Recipients (@)" and "Recipients Domains (@)" in message list containing full,
raw addresses of sender and recipient as well as their domains instead of just
names like in the default columns.

This add-on is reimplementation of "Show address only" which stopped working
in Thunderbird 78. This add-on source was originally based on "SFreq" by
Jorg K. Version working with Supernova update is based on examples provided by
John Bieling.
