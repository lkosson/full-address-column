Full address column
===================

This add-on adds four new columns called "Sender (@)", "Sender Domain (@)",
"Sender Reverse Domain (@)", "Recipients (@)", "Recipients Domains (@)" and
"Recipients Reverse Domains (@)" in message list containing full, raw addresses
of sender and recipient as well as their domains and reserved domains instead
of just names like in the default columns.

This add-on is reimplementation of "Show address only" which stopped working
in Thunderbird 78. This add-on source was originally based on "SFreq" by
Jorg K. Version working with Supernova update is based on examples provided by
John Bieling.
